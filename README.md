#Google app engine - Udacity CS253


This is a wiki/blog built with the help of cs253 class taught by [Steve Huffman] at [Udacity], I had the opportunity to learn a lot of programming concept about building web applications using the Python programming language. I want to thank you:

  - Steve and Sean
  - Udacity Forum
  - Stack Overflow
  - Google and all the people around it.
  - Wikipedia
  - O'Reilly fundation

For being such good collaborators. 

I learnt stuff that I really enjoyed like Python, Jinjja2, JavaScript, Ajax, memcache, cookies, RE, ...



###This application used Google App engine

I am currently putting our last assignment which is a little wiki. I planned to add the blog later on, I just want to integrate it well.
The application is tested on Google chrome, I will also try to make it run on every browser.

If you have any comments, I'll be glad to hear them. I am only a beginner once, so I better appreciate it for now.
